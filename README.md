**PROJECT PROGRESS** 

_Labelling images_

1. Retain already labeled files 
    - In already labeled and sorted files, there are duplicates and missing dates, why?

2. There are archived files...
    - Are they labeled? 
    - Should they be restructured?
    - Should they be resorted by WS/ year, are there duplicate labels? 

3. Other subfolders...
    - Are they labeled already?
